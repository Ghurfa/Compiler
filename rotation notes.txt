* is higher precedence than +

if left is lower precedence or equal precedence and right associative then rotate right


a = b = c
> (a = b) = c left is equal precedence and right-associative
> a = (b = c)

> a - b - c * d - e
> a - (b - c * d - e)
> a - (b - (c * d - e))
> a - (b - (c * (d - e)))
> a - (b - ((c * d) - e)) 	right is lower precedence
> a - ((b - (c * d)) - e)	right is equal precedence and left-associative
> (a - (b - (c * d))) - e	right is equal precedence and left-associative
> ((a - b) - (c * d)) - e	right is equal precedence and left-associative (need to recheck lef)
